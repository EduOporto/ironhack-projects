The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data every year -- giving communities the current information they need to plan investments and services. The ACS covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population.

The 5-year estimates from the ACS are "period" estimates that represent data collected over a period of time. The primary advantage of using multiyear estimates is the increased statistical reliability of the data for less populated areas and small population subgroups.

The 5-year estimates are available for all geographies down to the block group level.  In total, there are 87 different summary levels available with over 578,000 geographic areas.  Unlike the 1-year estimates, geographies do not have to meet a particular population threshold in order to be published.  Detail tables, Subject tables, Data Profiles, and Comparison profiles include the following geographies: nation, all states (including DC and Puerto Rico), all metropolitan areas, all congressional districts (116th congress), all counties, all places, all tracts and block groups.

 - Detailed Tables contain the most detailed cross-tabulations, many of which are published down to block groups. The data are population counts. There are over 20,000 variables in this dataset.
 - Subject Tables provide an overview of the estimates available in a particular topic.  The data are presented as population counts and percentages.  There are over 18,000 variables in this dataset. 
 - Data Profiles contain broad social, economic, housing, and demographic information. The data are presented as population counts and percentages. There are over 1,000 variables in this dataset.
 - Comparison Profiles are similar to Data Profiles but also include comparisons with past-year data.  The   current year data are compared with prior 5-Year data and include statistical significance testing.  There are over 1,000 variables in this dataset.
